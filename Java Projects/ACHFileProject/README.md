# ACH File Transfer Project

This was the first major project I created. My dad gave me this as an example of the many changes he wanted to make to the framework used at his company Fairmount Automation. 

The goal of this project was to generate an ACH file using information stored on company databases. This required me to understand the format of ACH files, and really helped me understand how objects and classes functioned, as well as how computer memory and object pointers worked. 

This program does not connect to the database, and uses sample values for many of the input fields, but if given the right information it could generate ACH files.

I haven't run this on VS Code, my primary IDE, but there have been no changes made to the project since I got this to work on the Eclipse IDE. However, a sample file called achExample.txt is provided to show a sample output of the project.
