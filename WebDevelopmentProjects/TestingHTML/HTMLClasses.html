        <h1>Classes Examples</h1>
        <p>
            This paragraph contains <span class = "span1">several</span> different classes. However this is all within the same element<span class = "span2">This can be shown visually using CSS.</span> 
            However, one element can belong to multiple classes. For example, take <span class="span3">class 1</span> and <span class="span4">class 2</span>. Both have unique CSS properties which are set by classes
            We can create a new element <span class ="span3 span4">class 3</span> that has the properties of both classes.
        </p>
        <p class="SameExample">
            Another example is how this text
        </p>
        <h4 class="SameExample">and this text have the same class but are different elements</h4>
        <!-- In JavaScript, you can access elements of a certain class using the getElementsByClassName("ClassName") function.-->
        <p id="IDExample">
            In contrast, an ID cannot be used on more than one element. The point of this is so that external files such as CSS and JS can edit a specific element

        </p>
        <p>This is the same element as the one above, but because the one above has an ID, it is modified in CSS.</p>

        <!--Similarly, in JS you can use the function getElementByID("IDName") to edit an element with a specific ID-->
