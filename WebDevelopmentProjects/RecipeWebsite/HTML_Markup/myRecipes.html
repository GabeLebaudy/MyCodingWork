        3. My Recipes
            - I want users to be able to create recipes. The steps for creating the recipe will be to tag the recipe with the required 
            ingredients for creating the recipe. Secondly, the user must input steps for how to cook the food, or how to prep ingredients.
            After that, they must tag the recipe with the necessary appliances needed to cook it, I.E. stove, oven, microwave etc...
            Once that is complete they can add optional appliance tags, for kitchen appliances that are helpful for completing the recipe
            but not completely necessary. Users should be able to toggle each optional appliance, and the creator of the recipe must tag
            steps that use optional appliances and create steps for those who do not have them. The last step for creating a recipe will be
            to add a timeframe tag and add an estimate of how long it will take, I.E. 30-45 min. Users will later be able to sort by 
            appliance, ingredient, and time tags.
