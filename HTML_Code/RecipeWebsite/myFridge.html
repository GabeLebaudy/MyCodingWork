        2. My Fridge
            - This will be its own separate page, but the purpose of this page is to add ingredients that you have in your fridge
            pantry, cabinets, etc. into one central location. The site will use this information to determine if you have the 
            ingredients for making the desired recipe. 
            - I also want the fridge to subtract said ingredients if the user chooses to make a recipe. The idea is that the recipe
            is tagged with the ingredients needed to make it, so those ingredients will be subtracted by the site automatically
            - This feature may be difficult and far in the future, but it would be interesting to search for ingredients, and add
            stores and potentially a geolocation feature that finds the nearest stores that sell such ingredients
