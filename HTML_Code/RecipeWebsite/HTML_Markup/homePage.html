            The purpose of this recipe website is to contain recipes I find online and want to keep here. 
            I may already know how to do it from scratch, but I want somewhere to store it and be able to remind me of it
            if I am unsure of what to make.

        1. Home page 
            - The home page should be the first page that pops up when you open the site, it should have navigation links
            for accessing the other pages of the website
            - Ideally in the future there will be a quick access page, which saves the previous three recipes used
