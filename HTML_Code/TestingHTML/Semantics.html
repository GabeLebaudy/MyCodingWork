        In html, there are certain elements that describe the content that is inside them. Those elements are semantic elements
        Some of these elements include <aside> <article> <details> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <header> 
        <main> <mark> <nav> <section> <summary> <time>
    -->
    <header>
        <h1>Semantics in HTML</h1>
    </header>
    <!--Example of Nav tags-->
    <nav>
        <a href = "HTMLBasicsDemo.html">Click here to see Garbage</a>
    </nav>
    <section id = "ArticleArea">
        <article>
            This is just some random text to populate website area. 
            The section elements do not change the appearance of the website untill CSS properties are used to modify them.
        </article>
    </section>
    <aside style = "float:right;">
        <p>This is just some example text that is being put into the aside element. In order for the element to look good a fair amount of CSS work is needed</p>
    </aside>
    <!--The figure element does not actually generate anything, it is just used to define a section of the website that is being dedicated to a figure-->
    <figure style = "max-width:100%;">
