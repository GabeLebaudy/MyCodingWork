# Youtube Video Download App

The purpose of this project is to create an application to be able to prompt the user for a youtube video link, and then choose where the video is to be stored in the file directory.

Some features I want to include:
 - Download Bar
 - Display the thumbnail picture of the video downloading
 - Have the path to storage where the video is saved to be saved across program executions.
 - Display all current video file names in a column on the left hand side of the screen
 - Input field for the file type for the video output
