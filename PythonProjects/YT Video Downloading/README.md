# Youtube Video Download App

## Warning: If you do not have FFmpeg installed on your PC, this application cannot download videos in 1080p.

This project was designed to be able to take in a youtube video URL, and download the video to a specified folder.

This application will show all videos in the current folder heirarchy selected, show the video information including publish date, title, description, and a picture of the thumbnail while downloading.

A handy feature this application has is the download queue, which allows the user to que many videos and then leave the application running as it downloads each one in turn. It also allows more videos to be added during this process.

Since this type of app goes into the downloading process on youtube, and the file manipulation, there are many more things that can be added to this, that I would like to add, but it is just not in my timeframe. I may come back to this later, but for now this is a beta phase for this app. It works for all videos that are not age restricted or private.
