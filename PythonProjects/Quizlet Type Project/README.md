# Quizlet Type Application

This project was made as an alternitve to paying for some of quizlet's features. Old gamemodes that used to be free like "Learn" are now free only up to 5 questions. 

The gamemodes I've included are the ones I was told are the most frequently used and the most helpful for learning about vocabulary. Flashcards and Learn correspond to those gamemodes on Quizlet, and Quiz is representation of the "Test" gamemode.
