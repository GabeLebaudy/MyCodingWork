# Handwritten digits NN classifier built from scratch

This project is an introduction for me in developing my own nueral networks. I've the Deep Learning course on coursera by Andrew Ng, and wanted to test out what I learned with the MNIST dataset, which seems to be very basic. 

My Goal is to get the model working around 98-99% accuracy, the code is a bit messy right now, as I've just tried to write some code to randomly test different hyperparameters, but if the test_model function is run, it uses the most up to date parameters which is around 95.5% accurate.
