# Handwritten digits and letters NN classification

This project will be for me to test my knowledge of building a nueral network. I'd like to build the model first from scratch, and attempt to implement optimization methods to try to improve the accuracy. 

Then I would like to use the same dataset to create a nueral network using TensorFlow, as I will be moving toward using that framework on the data moving forward.
