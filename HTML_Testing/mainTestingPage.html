    <h1>This will be my website for figuring out what to eat or make for dinner.</h1>
    <h3>Here are things I want to add as features to this website</h3>
    <p>This will be for the first part of the website, so it will exclude more advanced features that I will learn about later.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stores the recipes that I input into the system, which I will be able to view later.</li>
        <li>Each recipe will be tagged with every ingredient that is needed for the recipe</li>
        <li>Separate each recipe by a category i.e. "Pasta" or "Chicken", or create them as tags that can be added to each recipe for cases of overlap. </li>
        <li>Randomizer button that will give me a random recipe based on the chosen category(ies).</li>
    </ul>
