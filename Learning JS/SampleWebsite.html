            In this paragraph Element I will talk about my matchup predictions for wildcard weekend in the NFL. First, Seattle V.S. San Francisco:
            I believe that San Francisco will take care of business, but it will be a low scoring game and Seattle will cover the spread of +9.5.
            Jacksonville V.S. Los Angelos: I think that the Jaguars are hot, Mike Williams is out and the LA offense struggles. I think Jacksonville will win and cover the spread of +1.5.
            Miami V.S. Buffalo. Easy matchup for Josh Allen, No Tua for this game I think Buffalo wins and covers spread of -13.5. New York V.S. Minnesota:
            I think that Brian Daboll is a wizard of a head coach and that the vikings are frauds and don't deserve their record. I think the Giants will win and cover the spread +3.0.
            Baltimore V.S. Cincinatti: Lamar is out and even though the ravens defense is incredible I like the bengals offense more and therefore believe that the Bengals will win and cover -8.5.
            Dallas V.S. Tampa Bay: Oh boy this is the most unpredictable. I could really see anything happen in this game, a blowout for each team, comfortable win, or one score game either way.
            I don't like how Dallas entered the playoffs and Dak's nature in the playoffs and with Tom Brady's Luck this game could go any way. However, I see a low scoring game
            where Tampa Bay's Defense plays out of their mind gets a pick 6, and wins my prediction is that the Bucs win 17-14 and cover +3.
